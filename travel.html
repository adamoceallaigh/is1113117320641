                  <p>The Maldives is a tropical nation in the Indian Ocean composed of 26 ring-shaped atolls, which are made up of more than 1,000 coral islands. It’s known for its beaches, blue lagoons and extensive reefs. The capital, Malé, has a busy fish market, restaurants and shops on the main road, Majeedhee Magu, and 17th-century Hukuru Miskiy (also known as Friday Mosque) made of carved white coral.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>The islands are popular for snorkeling and diving due to the warm water, high visibility and diverse marine life, including manta rays and spotted whale sharks, which can grow to 12m long. Other popular water activities include swimming, surfing, sea kayaking and jet-skiing. Travel by boat or seaplane is common on inter-island trips from Malé to uninhabited islands or small fishing villages, many of which offer guesthouses or homestays. The most typical travel accommodations are luxury spa resorts and overwater bungalows on wooden stilts.</p>

                  <p>Chamonix-Mont-Blanc (usually shortened to Chamonix) is a resort area near the junction of France, Switzerland and Italy. At the base of Mont Blanc, the highest summit in the Alps, it's renowned for its skiing. Year-round, cable cars take visitors up to several nearby peaks with panoramic views, including Aiguille du Midi above town, and Pointe Helbronner, across vast glacier fields on the Italian border.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>The slopes surrounding Chamonix have many kilometres of ski and snowboard trails, including the legendary 17km off-piste (backcountry) descent of La Vallée Blanche. The funicular Montenvers train connects Chamonix to the 7km-long Mer de Glace glacier and a cave with ice sculptures carved out beneath it. Chamonix’s bars and restaurants host a lively après-ski party scene. In summer, paragliders take flight from Plan de l’Aiguille and mountaineers tackle the 4208m-high Grandes Jorasses. Chamonix is also a base for trekking the alpine trails that connect Chamonix to Switzerland and Italy.</p>

                  <p>San Jose is a large city surrounded by rolling hills in Silicon Valley, a major technology hub in California's Bay Area. Architectural landmarks, from the 1883 Italianate-style Oddfellows building to Spanish Colonial Revival structures, make up the downtown historic district. The downtown area is also home to the Tech Museum of Innovation, devoted to the exploration of science and technology.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Staircases lead to nowhere at the legendary Winchester Mystery House, a sprawling Victorian mansion known for its elaborate maze of secret passageways. Artifacts dating from Egypt's Predynastic period through its early Islamic era are on display at the Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum, while the San Jose Museum of Art showcases contemporary works with an emphasis on West Coast art. Thousands of vendors gather several days a week at the San Jose Flea Market, outfitted with a carousel and mini Ferris wheel. At the Municipal Rose Garden, colorful blooms grow on an expanse of green space.</p>
