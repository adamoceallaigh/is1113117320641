    	    		 <h2>Easily Accessible</h2>
    	             <p>With the rise of popularity of the cloud we can see a decrease in the amount of people using USB's as their daily storage unit anymore and why shouldn't it be that way. USB's are very fragile, easily damageable, prone to be lost and viruses are a possibility also. With cloud these problems evaporate and are thrown aside in place of a more stable, easily accessible storage unit that can be virtually be accessed from any place in the world with internet.This is one of the reasons why over the last couple of years i've taken an interest in developments of the cloud computing industry</p>

    	    		 <h2>Convenient</h2>
    	             <p>My second reason why i love the cloud is the fact that the cloud is very convenient to all. For employees, the cloud enables them to transfer/exchange data and work immediately and very fast. It also enables employees to work on the same document or work/task simultaneously and this increases productivity and invariably profits. This new development in technology interested me a lot as it allows work to be done on time and much faster and the other feature of the cloud is that it now enables employees to work from home.  </p>

	    		 <h2>Backup</h2>
	             <p>The third aspect i like and that interests me is the stablility and storage capacity of the cloud. No longer do people have to carry around a few USB's at the same time at risk of losing damaging or obtaining a virus on your USB which would invariably damage/lose all content you were currently working on. Also with the cloud you get the very handy auto upload function so even if you forget to upload to the cloud as you're too busy, the moment you produce the photo or document, anything you're working on is automatically uploaded. The other aspect that interests me about the cloud is the fact that if you do run into an unforeseen accident/circumstance with power outage etc. your work is automatically saved and is available whenever you go back on the computer.</p>

			  <div id="section4" class="section">
				<img src="images/cloudstorage.png">
    	    		 <h2>Storage</h2>
    	             <p>The last aspect that interests me is the storage capacity of this virtual storage unit. The fact that this virtual cloud can store large amounts of kilobytes and still function is very interesting. The whole idea of this cloud means people get more storage space for less money, you would have to spend a lot of money on a few USB's with massive storage capacity to obtain the same storage capacity as the cloud therefore this virtual cloud saves money and as a result increases profits. </p>
