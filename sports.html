                    <h1> FOOTBALL \ SOCCER</h1>
                    <p>My interest in football \ soccer stems from an early age. When I was as young as 4 I inherited in my dad's passion for gaelic football, with him being the manager of almost 6 underage teams including my one,i had no choice really.
                    My dad coached me in my backyard nearly everyday and i improved greatly as a result. I started taking a genuine interest in both sports when i discovered my passion for the Premier League.My favourite team was and is still Chelsea Football Club.I enjoy watching the premier league games on tv and I was privileged to have the opportunity to travel to Stamford Bridge to watch my team live. I played multiple underage games in both codes respectively and have achieved a few county championships in the process.</p>

                      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a very strong passion for my second interest: Swimming. I have been &nbsp;&nbsp;swimming all my life so far and have achieved national medals in this &nbsp;&nbsp;sport.&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to this year, I was swimming almost 17 hours a week early mornings &nbsp;&nbsp;before school included. My favourite stroke is backstroke and my favourite &nbsp;&nbsp;swimmer has to be Michael Phelps. I had the honour of watching him swim &nbsp;&nbsp;live at the London 2012 Olympics, before he retired the first time. I have also &nbsp;&nbsp;benefited from my time swimming by completing all courses and are now &nbsp;&nbsp;teaching swimming as a part time job and i'm currently qualified as an &nbsp;&nbsp;internationally qualified lifeguard.  </p>

                 <p>My third interest is one that i enjoy doing a lot. Ever since I was young, I've been continuously busy with activities and sports owing to my fitness levels. Swimming is a highly active sport and it is through this that I have learned to love being fit and healthy. I go to the gym almost every two days, I enjoy the feeling of being fresh and healthy and as a result of this I also do a lot of cardio work ranging from swimming to runs in the morning.</p>
